## üéØ Focus Areas

### Primary Development Focus
1. **Sophisticated Fitting Recommendations** - The core value proposition
2. **ESI Integration** - Essential for real-time data
3. **SDE Integration** - Required for accurate calculations

### Key Success Metrics
- Accurate skill-aware fitting recommendations
- Real-time performance with 3D interface
- Seamless ESI authentication and data sync
- Comprehensive bonus calculations (skills + ship + modules)

## üìù Notes

- **Voice/Gesture/Eye Tracking**: Removed from scope - using traditional mouse/keyboard controls
- **Ship Recommendations**: Focus on sophisticated fitting optimization, not simple activity-based suggestions  
- **Bonus Integration**: Critical that all skill bonuses, ship bonuses, and module bonuses are properly calculated
- **Multi-Vector Analysis**: Must optimize for different goals (DPS, tank, range, speed, etc.)
- **Efficiency Algorithms**: Core differentiator - advanced mathematical optimization of fitting combinations

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Start work on the Advanced Fitting Recommendation Engine
2. Define the mathematical framework for bonus calculations
3. Create the activity-based recommendation system architecture
4. Implement skill-aware optimization algorithms
