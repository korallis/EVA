EVA - Futuristic Holographic UI Style Guide (Updated with SVG Mockups)

Overview
This document outlines the complete design system for EVA's futuristic, transparent, holographic interface based on the reference design. The goal is to create a cohesive, animated, sci-fi interface that feels immersive and cutting-edge.
Design Philosophy
Holographic Transparency: All UI elements should appear to float in 3D space with glass-like transparency
Futuristic Minimalism: Clean lines, geometric shapes, and purposeful negative space
Dynamic Animation: Subtle animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting
Consistent Visual Language: All components follow the same design principles and visual hierarchy

How to Implement the Look
Use the Main Dashboard mockup as the definitive reference for all panel shapes, colors, fonts, and effects
For every new page, adapt the layout to the content, but always use:
Transparent, glassy panels with glowing cyan borders
White and cyan text in sci-fi fonts
Consistent panel spacing, rounded corners, and drop shadows
Animated progress and hover effects
All mockups now provided as high-fidelity SVG references for precise implementation
Example CSS Snippet
