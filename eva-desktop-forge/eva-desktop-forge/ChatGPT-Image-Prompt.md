**PROMPT:**

Create a high-quality PNG mockup of a futuristic holographic user interface for a space/EVE Online style application. The design should be:

**Visual Style:**
- Dark space background (#0A0A1A to #1A1A2E gradient)
- Transparent glassmorphic panels with subtle cyan tint
- Glowing cyan borders (#00D4FF) around all panels
- Futuristic sci-fi aesthetic with clean minimalist design
- Subtle transparency and backdrop blur effects
- Floating panel appearance with soft drop shadows

**Layout (3-column design):**

**Left Panel - "SKILL ANALYSIS":**
- Header with "SKILL ANALYSIS" title in cyan
- Circular progress indicator showing "75%" with glowing cyan ring
- "3,467,020 SP" text below the circle
- List of skill categories with expand arrows (â–¶):
  - Spaceship Command
  - Gunnery 
  - Missiles
  - Drones
  - Engineering
- Skill queue section at bottom showing training items

**Center Panel - "SHIP FITTING":**
- Header with "SHIP FITTING" title in cyan
- Three sections for ship slots:
  - "High Slots" section with 4 module slots, 3 filled with "Heavy Missile" modules
  - "Medium Slots" section with 4 slots, showing shield/propulsion modules
  - "Low Slots" section with 5 slots, showing damage control and shield modules
- Each filled slot shows module icon/checkbox, module name, and quantity (1X, 2X, 3X)
- Empty slots shown with dotted borders

**Right Panel - "SHIP STATS":**
- Header with "SHIP STATS" title in cyan
- Multiple stat sections:
  - Power section showing "4475.1/1500" 
  - CPU section showing "225.8/575.0"
  - DPS showing "625.5"
  - Defenses showing Shield/Armor/Hull values
  - Navigation showing Speed/Agility

**Typography:**
- Use futuristic/sci-fi font (Orbitron, Exo, or similar)
- White text for main content
- Cyan (#00D4FF) for headers and accents
- Proper spacing and alignment

**Colors:**
- Background: Dark space (#0A0A1A)
- Panel backgrounds: Transparent with cyan tint
- Borders: Glowing cyan (#00D4FF)
- Text: White (#FFFFFF) for main, cyan for accents
- UI elements: Clean, minimal, holographic appearance

Make it look like a professional spacecraft/space station interface with a holographic, transparent, futuristic aesthetic. The overall feel should be sleek, high-tech, and immersive.

**Alternative shorter version for other AI tools:**

Create a futuristic holographic UI mockup with 3 transparent glassmorphic panels on dark space background. Left panel: "SKILL ANALYSIS" with circular progress (75%), skill categories list. Center panel: "SHIP FITTING" with high/medium/low slots showing missile modules. Right panel: "SHIP STATS" with power, CPU, DPS stats. Use cyan glowing borders, white text, sci-fi fonts. Style: EVE Online/space station interface, transparent panels, holographic aesthetic.
