# SDE Data Status (16 June 2025)

**Current SDE database (eve-sde.db) contains only demo/test data.**

| Entity Type         | Count |
|---------------------|-------|
| Categories          | 3     |
| Groups              | 8     |
| Market Groups       | 0     |
| Ships               | 10    |
| Modules (all types) | 10    |
| Dogma Attributes    | 0     |
| Dogma Effects       | 0     |
| Type Attributes     | 0     |
| Type Effects        | 0     |
| Skill Requirements  | 0     |
| Fittings            | 0     |

**Why is this so small?**
- The app is currently loading only demo/test data into the SDE database.
- The full EVE SDE (which is very large) has not been imported or the import did not complete successfully.
- To get full data, ensure the comprehensive SDE import runs with access to all CCP SDE YAML files and completes without errors.
